## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Reports table
CREATE TABLE reports (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    location GEOMETRY(POINT, 4326) NOT NULL,
    address TEXT,
    problem_category TEXT NOT NULL,
    severity_level TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    weather_conditions TEXT,
    contact_info TEXT,
    photos TEXT[], -- Array of S3 URLs
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'new',
    admin_notes TEXT,
    resolved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_reports_location ON reports USING GIST(location);
CREATE INDEX idx_reports_created_at ON reports (created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_reports_status ON reports (status);
```

### API Endpoints Design
```typescript
// Report submission
POST /api/reports
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body: {
  latitude: number,
  longitude: number,
  address: string,
  problemCategory: string,
  severityLevel: string,
  description: string,
  weatherConditions: string,
  contactInfo?: string,
  photos: File[]
}

// Get reports with geospatial filtering
GET /api/reports?lat=40.7128&lng=-74.0060&radius=10&limit=50
Response: {
  reports: Report[],
  totalCount: number
}

// Admin endpoints
GET /api/admin/reports - List all reports for review
PUT /api/admin/reports/:id/status - Update report status
POST /api/admin/reports/:id/notes - Add admin notes
```
