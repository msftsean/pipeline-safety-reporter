# Pipeline Safety Reporter Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Safety-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every feature, design decision, and code change must prioritize user safety and system reliability. Emergency reporting functionality takes precedence over all other features. All user interfaces must be optimized for rapid, stress-free emergency reporting. No feature may compromise the core safety reporting workflow speed or reliability.

### II. Anonymous-by-Design
User privacy and anonymity are fundamental rights, not optional features. No personally identifiable information may be collected without explicit user consent. All data collection must have a clear safety justification. User location data is handled with maximum security and minimal retention. Contact information is optional and encrypted when provided.

### III. Mobile-First Emergency UX
The application must function flawlessly on mobile devices in emergency situations. Touch targets must be large enough for use under stress. Form fields must be minimal and intuitive. GPS location capture must be automatic with manual fallback. Photo uploads must work reliably on poor network connections. Loading times must be under 3 seconds on 3G networks.

### IV. Zero-Barrier Reporting
No user registration, login, or account creation may be required for emergency reporting. Report submission must work with minimal user input - location, description, and severity are sufficient. Every additional form field must be justified for safety value. Progressive enhancement allows for optional additional data without blocking core functionality.

### V. Geographic Data Integrity
Location accuracy is critical for emergency response effectiveness. GPS coordinates must be validated and cross-referenced with address data. All geospatial queries must be optimized for performance with proper indexing. Location data must be stored with appropriate precision for pipeline safety analysis. Map displays must accurately represent report locations and severity levels.

## Security Requirements

### Data Protection Standards
All data transmission must use HTTPS with proper certificate validation. User-uploaded photos must be scanned for malware and stripped of personal metadata. Database connections must use encrypted connections and parameterized queries. Input validation must prevent injection attacks on all user-submitted data. Rate limiting must prevent abuse while allowing legitimate emergency reporting.

### Privacy Safeguards
User IP addresses may be logged for security but not linked to reports without legal requirement. Photo EXIF data must be stripped except for location information when relevant to safety. Optional contact information must be encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption. Data retention policies must balance safety analysis needs with privacy rights. No third-party analytics may track individual user behavior.

## Performance Standards

### Response Time Requirements
Initial page load must complete within 3 seconds on 3G mobile connections. Report submission must provide immediate feedback within 1 second of form submission. Map displays must render within 2 seconds with basic functionality available immediately. Photo uploads must show progress indicators for operations taking longer than 2 seconds. Database queries must be optimized to prevent blocking operations.

### Reliability Targets
System uptime must exceed 99.5% availability during normal operations. Database backups must be automated and tested monthly. Error handling must provide clear, non-technical guidance to users. Graceful degradation must allow core reporting functionality even when advanced features fail. Monitoring must alert operations teams to performance degradation before user impact.

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Gates
All code must pass automated testing before deployment to production. Security scanning must be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Code reviews must verify compliance with safety-first principles. Performance testing must validate response time requirements. Accessibility testing must ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for emergency use scenarios.

### Testing Requirements
Unit tests must cover all critical safety-related functions with >90% coverage. Integration tests must validate end-to-end reporting workflows. Performance tests must simulate emergency usage patterns under load. Security tests must validate input handling and authentication mechanisms. User acceptance testing must include real-world emergency scenario simulations.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and technical decisions. All pull requests must include a compliance statement verifying adherence to safety-first principles. Feature requests must be evaluated against emergency use case impact. Technical debt that impacts safety functionality must be prioritized for immediate resolution.

Amendments to this constitution require:
1. Documentation of safety impact analysis
2. Review by project stakeholders including safety personnel
3. Migration plan for existing functionality
4. Updated testing requirements to validate new principles
